# CS-102-PROJECT-TETRACE
# INTRODUCTION
Tet-race is a Tetris-like game and desktop application that promises its users a fun time while users try to solve the puzzle that the game provides to them. They should be aiming to fill the lines with the blocks without any spaces before the blocks pile up to the ceiling. This game differs from Tetris as while playing, they will encounter many different challenges such as rival interference, time-freezing, screen change, and barriers. They will also be rewarded with many gifts that they can collect throughout the game. After they finish their current level, they will move on to the next level, with different features than the previous level as levels get progressively more challenging. Players can purchase some tools and features with their coins that they will earn after every level up, which will be helpful to win the game. With different mode options, players have the freedom to choose and play which one they like, such as limitless mode, multiplayer mode, and story mode. This game is suitable for people of all ages.
